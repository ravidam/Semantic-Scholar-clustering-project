# Semantic-Scholar-clustering-project

With the exponential growth of research articles across various fields,
researchers, students, and professionals face challenges in staying updated and
extracting relevant information.
Our objective is to address these challenges by developing a tool that
streamlines the process of article analysis.
By allowing users to explore articles based on their field of study, time period,
and quantity preferences, we envision our tool making a significant impact on
how research is conducted, and insights are derived from scholarly literature.
